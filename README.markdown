### What is moaDB?
MoaDB is a free web-based **[MongoDB](http://mongodb.org)** GUI. The project is focused on maintaining a very simple interface along with an easy setup.
Helpful query validation, amazing lightweight UI , advanced nested and wildcard searching, and much more.

### Browsers

Chome, Firefox, Safari. 
Some might think of it as a limitation, but I'am calling it a feature: Not supporting IE saves time.

### Getting Started

MoaDB works with PHP5+ and requires **[Mongo PHP Driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver/tree/master)** to be installed and running.

To setup MoaDB :

 	- Copy the `moaDB` folder to a secure path on your web site.
 
Then your done, but you might want to :

 	- Change the `.htaccess` file in order to block unwanted authorization.
	- Check out the config settings in `resources/php/config.php`.

Finally go to the URL pointing to moaDB on your web site.
