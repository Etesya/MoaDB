### What is moaDB?
MoaDB is a free web-based **[MongoDB](http://mongodb.org)** GUI. The project is focused around a very simple interface and easy implementation.
Helpful query validation, amazing lightweight UI , advanced nested and wildcard searching, and much more.

### Browsers

Chome, Firefox, Safari. 
May sound like a limitation, but I'am calling it a feature: Not supporting IE saves time.

### Getting Started

MoaDB works with PHP5+  and requires **[Mongo PHP Driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver/tree/master) to be installed and running.

To setup MoaDB :
	Copy the `moaDB` folder to a secure path on your web site.
Then your done, but you might want to :
 - Change the `.htaccess` file in order to block unwanted authorization.
 - Check out the config settings in `resources/php/config.php`.

### Contribute

The project was knocked up very quickly for a particular use-case but I have now 
decided to continue to clean it up and share the love.
Feel free to contribute to MoaDB. Make sure your methods are
tested on the support browsers, and that any new functionality includes appropriate comments.
