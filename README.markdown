### What is moaDB?
MoaDB is a free web-based **[MongoDB](http://mongodb.org)** GUI. The project is focused on maintaining a very simple interface along with an easy setup.
Helpful query validation, amazing lightweight UI , advanced nested and wildcard searching, and much more.

### Browsers

Chome, Firefox, Safari. 
Some might think of it as a limitation, but I'am calling it a feature: Not supporting IE saves time.

### Getting Started

MoaDB works with PHP5+ and requires **[Mongo PHP Driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver/tree/master)** to be installed and running.

To setup MoaDB :

 	- Copy the `moaDB` folder to a secure path on your web site.
 
Then your done, but you might want to :

 	- Change the `.htaccess` file in order to block unwanted authorization.
	- Check out the config settings in `resources/php/config.php`.

Finally go to the URL pointing to moaDB on your web site.

### Contribute

This project started out as a quick fix, for a GUI to support mongo ssl, but I have now 
decided to continue improving it and share the love.
Feel free to contribute to MoaDB. Make sure your methods are
tested on the support browsers, and that any new functionality includes appropriate comments.
